**What.** Two stopgap rows in the people-moves engine keep movers from leaving: a holder of a job a saved agreement names as its provider's qualification (SG-P15-moves-pinned-jobs), and a person whose income award is paid into a household others stay in (SG-FIXER-moves-income-household). The first row also says moves keeps its own copy of the jobs engine's lookup. That copy is gone: both engines now read one lookup in `src/core2/pinned-jobs.ts`. Letting these people actually move needs two changes in other engines, filed as their own items.

**Rules.** Replace, never layer: the duplicated lookup is deleted in the same change. Wire to the world: the movers leave only when the agreement and the award can follow them.

**Done when.** The shared lookup is the only copy (the jobs and moves tests pass in a drawn place), and the item is done when `world-agreements-re-resolve-worker` and `core-income-award-follows-person` are done and both stopgap rows are resolved. The test in src/core2/moves.test.ts shows a pinned-job holder and an award recipient leaving in a played world (buildBenchWorld) by record id.

**Files.** src/core2/pinned-jobs.ts, src/core2/modules/jobs.ts, src/core2/modules/moves.ts

**Notes.** The old pool body was the empty template; this is the real one. Split Oct 15: the duplicate copy is removed in this PR, the two row replacements are the blocked-on items.

Oct 20: Everything it waited on is done, so it is open.
